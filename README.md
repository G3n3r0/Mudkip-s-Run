Mudkip's Run
============

The story of how a lone meme saved teh webs.

Back Story
----------

Mudkip and his friends were on a journey across the Dopamine Sea which is at the south of Facebook.
They left from a small island in the Farmville region of Facebook, heading to the land of 4Chan to find the great secrets hidden there.
However, a great storm blew them far off course, wrecking their ship.
Mudkip wakes up on a far-off island. It appears to be in the gossip blog county of the great island of Blogos. But to his surprise, the island is filled with evil members of the troll race.
These creatures were created by the dark lord Yustealmathots. They were intended to be used as troops against the hordes of people who wanted to put a song in a video of their cat without paying with their immortal soul.
But something went wrong. These creatures began going across the webs, wreaking havoc. They even destroyed the once-peacful Water Bay, turning it into the Flame Bay. However, in the past, the great warriors of Mod had controlled these creatures. But now, it was up to Mudkip.

So yeah, it's full of open sourciness.
